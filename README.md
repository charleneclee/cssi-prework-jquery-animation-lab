# Lab - When Pigs Fly
There are some basic jQuery events in script.js, and a cute image of a pig in pig.html. Open this repo on Github and clone these files onto your local machine.

## Step 1: Animate the Pigs when you Click the Fly Button
Add a third button called "Fly" that makes the pig "fly" by moving right and exiting the screen.
* Check out the .animate() documentation to get this to happen.
* In CSS, change the `img` elements to be styled with a position other than the static - which is the default. Otherwise the pigs won't be able to move.


## Step 2: Jump on Mouse Click
Use what you learned about jQuery events to have the pig slide up and down when 3 times it is clicked.

## Step 3: Add a New Pig
Modify the HTML to add a new pig *to the right* of your current pig. You might have to play around with the CSS layout properties.

## **Stretch:** Follow the Leader
Create an event where once the first pig flies away, the other one follows automatically after a set period of time.
